## What is Active Directory?

Active Directory, also referred to as AD is a powerful tool for managing network resources in a Windows environment.  AD is a live directyory that stores account login data and information on other resouces with a Network.

As a directory service, AD uses a hierarchical structure to organize information.
Unlike a basic database, which is simply a storage tool, AD is dynamic â€“ it lets IT administrators search and manage the resources on the database so they can constantly ensure the network hierarchy is organized properly.
